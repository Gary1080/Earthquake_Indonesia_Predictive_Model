# Datasheet Template - For Earthquake Prediction Model

## Motivation

The dataset was created to record and analyse earthquake occurrences in Indonesia, a country with one of the highest earthquake rates in the world due to its location in the Pacific Ring of Fire. This data is valuable for understanding seismic activity patterns, assessing risks, and enhancing disaster preparedness and response strategies.

The dataset was created by the Badan Meteorologi, Klimatologi, dan Geofisika (BMKG) Indonesia, also known as the Meteorology, Climatology, and Geophysical Agency of Indonesia. The dataset is funded and maintained by the BMKG, a governmental agency of Indonesia.
 
## Composition

The instances in the dataset represent individual earthquake occurrences, each described by attributes such as date, time, latitude, longitude, depth, and magnitude.

The dataset contains thousands of records spanning from November 1, 2008, to September 26, 2022. There is no missing data.

The dataset does not contain confidential information. It includes only public data about earthquake occurrences and does not involve personal or sensitive information.

## Collection process

The data was acquired through seismic monitoring systems managed by the BMKG, which continuously record earthquake activity in Indonesia.

The dataset is not a sample; it represents all recorded earthquake occurrences in the specified period which was collected continuously from November 1, 2008, to September 26, 2022.

## Preprocessing/cleaning/labelling

There is no specific information provided about preprocessing, cleaning, or labeling of the data. It appears that the data is presented in its raw form as recorded by the seismic monitoring systems.
 
## Uses

Potential Uses:

    * Seismic research and analysis
    * Earthquake prediction modeling
    * Disaster preparedness and response planning
    * Educational purposes
    * Geospatial analysis and mapping of seismic activity

The dataset's comprehensive nature and lack of personal data minimise risks of unfair treatment or harm.
Users should ensure they understand the dataset's limitations, such as the precision of recorded locations and depths.

The dataset should not be used for any purpose involving personal data analysis or applications requiring confidential information, as it contains only public data about seismic events.

## Distribution

The dataset is available for download on Kaggle and is publicly accessible.

The dataset is subject to copyright by the original authors (BMKG) and is provided under specific terms of use, which likely include attribution requirements and possibly restrictions on commercial use.

## Maintenance

The dataset is maintained by BMKG Indonesia, which is responsible for its updates and accuracy. The update frequency is annually, although the last update was two years ago as of the information provided.
